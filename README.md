## 🔹 1. What is a _Hash Table_?

### Answer

A **Hash Table**, also known as a **Hash Map**, is a data structure that provides a mechanism to **store** and **retrieve data** based on **key-value** pairs.

It is an **associative array** abstract data type where the key is hashed, and the resulting hash value is used as an index to locate the corresponding value in a **bucket** or **slot**.

### Key Features

- **Unique Keys**: Each key in the hash table maps to a single value.
- **Dynamic Sizing**: Can adjust its size based on the number of elements.
- **Fast Operations**: Average time complexity for most operations is $O(1)$.

### Visual Representation

![Hash Table Example](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Hash_table_3_1_1_0_1_0_0_SP.svg/1920px-Hash_table_3_1_1_0_1_0_0_SP.svg.png)

### Core Components

#### Hash Function

The **hash function** converts each key to a numerical **hash value**, which is then used to determine the storage location, or "bucket."

#### Buckets

**Buckets** are containers within the hash table that hold the key-value pairs. The hash function aims to distribute keys uniformly across buckets to minimize collisions.

### Collision Handling

- **Open-Addressing**: Finds the next available bucket if a collision occurs.
- **Chaining**: Stores colliding keys in a linked list within the same bucket.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: $O(1)$ - average and best-case, $O(n)$ - worst-case.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n)$

### Code Example: Hash Table

Here is the Python code:

```python
# Initialize a hash table
hash_table = {}

# Add key-value pairs
hash_table['apple'] = 5
hash_table['banana'] = 2
hash_table['cherry'] = 3

# Retrieve a value
print(hash_table['apple'])  # Output: 5

# Update a value
hash_table['banana'] = 4

# Remove a key-value pair
del hash_table['cherry']
```

## 🔹 2. Explain the _Time_ and _Space Complexity_ of a _Hash Table_.

### Answer

**Hash tables** offer impressive time and space performance under most conditions. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Time Complexity

- **Best Case $O(1)$**: With uniform distribution and no collisions, fundamental operations like lookup, insertion, and deletion are constant-time.

- **Average and Amortized Case $O(1)$**: Even with occasional collisions and rehashing, most operations typically remain constant-time. While rehashing can sometimes take $O(n)$, its infrequency across many $O(1)$ operations ensures an overall constant-time complexity.

- **Worst Case $O(n)$**: Arises when all keys map to one bucket, forming a linked list. Such cases are rare and typically result from suboptimal hash functions or unique data distributions.

### Space Complexity $O(n)$

The primary storage revolves around the $n$ elements in the table. Additional overhead from the structure itself is minimal, ensuring an upper bound of $O(n)$. The "load factor," indicating the ratio of stored elements to the table's capacity, can impact memory use.

## 🔹 3. What is _Hashing_?

### Answer

**Hashing** is a method that maps data to fixed-size values, known as **hash values**, for efficient storage and retrieval. A **hash function** generates these values, serving as the data's unique identifier or key.

### Key Features

- **Speed**: Hashing offers constant-time complexity for data operations.
- **Data Integrity**: A good hash function ensures even minor data changes will yield different hash values.
- **Security**: Cryptographic hashes are essential in secure data transmission.
- **Collision Management**: While hash collisions can occur, they are manageable and typically rare.

### Hash Functions and Hash Values

A **hash function** generates a fixed-size **hash value**, serving as the data's unique identifier or key for various applications like data indexing and integrity checks. Hash values are typically represented as **hexadecimal numbers**.

#### Key Characteristics

- **Deterministic**: The same input will always produce the same hash value.
- **Fixed-Length Output**: Outputs have a consistent length, making them suitable for data structures like hash tables.
- **Speed**: Hash functions are designed for quick computation.
- **One-Way Functionality**: Reconstructing the original input from the hash value should be computationally infeasible.
- **Avalanche Effect**: Small input changes should result in significantly different hash values.
- **Collision Resistance**: While it's difficult to completely avoid duplicate hash values for unique inputs, well-designed hash functions aim to minimize this risk.

### Popular Hashing Algorithms

- **MD5**: Obsolete due to vulnerabilities.
- **SHA Family**:
  - SHA-1: Deprecated; collision risks.
  - SHA-256: Widely used in cryptography.

### Practical Applications

- **Databases**: For quick data retrieval through hash indices.
- **Distributed Systems**: For data partitioning and load balancing.
- **Cryptography**: To ensure data integrity.
- **Caching**: For efficient in-memory data storage and access.

### Code Example: SHA-256 with `hashlib`

Here is the Python code:

```python
import hashlib

def compute_sha256(s):
    hasher = hashlib.sha256(s.encode())
    return hasher.hexdigest()

print(compute_sha256("Hello, World!"))
```

## 🔹 4. Explain the difference between _Hashing_ and _Hash Tables_.

### Answer

When discussing **Hashing** and **Hash Tables**, it's crucial to recognize that one is a **technique** while the other is a **data structure**. Here's a side-by-side comparison:

### Key Distinctions

#### Definition

- **Hashing**: A computational technique that converts input (often a string) into a fixed-size value, referred to as a hash value.
- **Hash Tables**: A data structure that utilizes hash values as keys to efficiently store and retrieve data in memory.

#### Primary Function

- **Hashing**: To generate a unique identifier (hash value) for a given input, ensuring consistency and rapid computation.
- **Hash Tables**: To facilitate quick access to data by mapping it to a hash value, which determines its position in the table.

#### Application Areas

- **Hashing**: Common in cryptography for secure data transmission, data integrity checks, and digital signatures.
- **Hash Tables**: Used in programming and database systems to optimize data retrieval operations.

#### Inherent Complexity

- **Hashing**: Focuses solely on deriving a hash value from input data.
- **Hash Tables**: Incorporates mechanisms to manage issues like hash collisions (when two distinct inputs produce the same hash value) and may also involve dynamic resizing to accommodate growing datasets.

#### Operational Performance

- **Hashing**: Producing a hash value is typically an $O(1)$ operation, given a consistent input size.
- **Hash Tables**: On average, operations such as data insertion, retrieval, and deletion have $O(1)$ time complexity, although worst-case scenarios can degrade performance.

#### Persistence

- **Hashing**: Transient in nature; once the hash value is generated, the original input data isn't inherently stored or preserved.
- **Hash Tables**: Persistent storage structure; retains both the input data and its corresponding hash value in the table.

## 🔹 5. Provide a simple example of a _Hash Function_.

### Answer

The **parity function** can serve as a rudimentary example of a **hash function**. It takes a single input, usually an integer, and returns either `0` or `1` based on whether the input number is even or odd.

### Properties of the Parity Function

- **Deterministic**: Given the same number, the function will always return the same output.
- **Efficient**: Computing the parity of a number can be done in constant time.
- **Small Output Space**: The output is limited to two possible values, `0` or `1`.
- **One-Way Function**: Given one of the outputs (`0` or `1`), it is impossible to determine the original input.

### Code Example: Parity Function

Here is the Python code:

```python
def hash_parity(n: int) -> int:
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return 0
    return 1
```

### Real-World Hash Functions

While the parity function serves as a simple example, **real-world hash functions** are much more complex. They often use cryptographic algorithms to provide a higher level of security and other features like the ones mentioned below:

- **Cryptographic Hash Functions**: Designed to be secure against various attacks like pre-image, second-pre-image, and collision.
- **Non-Cryptographic Hash Functions**: Used for general-purpose applications, data storage, and retrieval.
- **Perfect Hash Functions**: Provide a unique hash value for each distinct input.

## 🔹 6. What are _Hash Collisions_?

### Answer

In hash functions and tables, a **hash collision** occurs when two distinct keys generate the same hash value or index. Efficiently addressing these collisions is crucial for maintaining the hash table's performance.

### Causes of Collisions

- **Hash Function Limitations**: No hash function is perfect; certain datasets may result in more collisions.
- **Limited Hash Space**: Due to the Pigeonhole Principle, if there are more unique keys than slots, collisions are inevitable.

### Collisions Types

- **Direct**: When two keys naturally map to the same index.
- **Secondary**: Arising during the resolution of a direct collision, often due to strategies like chaining or open addressing.

### Probability

The likelihood of a collision is influenced by the hash function's design, the number of available buckets, and the table's load factor.

**Worst-case** scenarios where all keys collide to the same index, can degrade a hash table's performance from $O(1)$ to $O(n)$.

### Strategies for Collision Resolution

- **Chaining**: Each slot in the hash table contains a secondary data structure, like a linked list, to hold colliding keys.
- **Open Addressing**: The hash table looks for the next available slot to accommodate the colliding key.
- **Cryptographic Hash Functions**: These are primarily used to ensure data integrity and security due to their reduced collision probabilities. However, they're not commonly used for general hash tables because of their slower performance.

### Illustrative Example

Consider a hash table that employs chaining to resolve collisions:

| Index | Keys        |
|-------|-------------|
| 3     | key1, key2  |

Inserting a new key that hashes to index 3 causes a collision. With chaining, the new state becomes:

| Index | Keys           |
|-------|----------------|
| 3     | key1, key2, key7 |

### Key Takeaways

- **Hash Collisions are Inevitable**: Due to inherent mathematical and practical constraints.
- **Strategies Matter**: The efficiency of a hash table can be significantly influenced by the chosen collision resolution strategy.
- **Probability Awareness**: Being aware of collision probabilities is vital, especially in applications demanding high performance or security.
